# Structure definitions

This project is for structure definitions of various file formats, like those
used by Okteta or Kaitai Struct. Often file formats are described by prose and
many small individual structure descriptions but this can make it difficult to
figure out how all the pieces work together in practice. This project focuses on
creating declarative descriptions which can be used with example files to
understand these file formats better. The emphasis is on being educational and
useful.
